# Portfolio Website

Hi! This is a personal portfolio website were I designed to showcase my professional work and design skills. The website is built using **ReactJS**, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience. The design focuses on clarity, functionality, and aesthetics, with smooth animations and interactive elements.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: the website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Interactive Elements**: smooth animations powered by **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**, adding dynamic effects to enhance the user experience.
- **Project Showcase**: the website features a gallery that dynamically loads and displays different projects, including web design, graphic design, video production, and more.
- **Project Filters**: allows users to filter projects by categories such as Web Design, Video, and Graphics for easier navigation..
- **Multilingual Support**: the website supports multiple languages, allowing users to switch between English, French and Spanish.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: for building the dynamic user interface and handling routing.
- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**: for smooth scroll animations and transitions.
- **React Router**: for navigation between different sections of the website.
- **React Icons**: for modern, clean icons used across the website.
- **CSS3**: for styling and layout adjustments.
- **HTML5**: for the structure and content of the site.

## Website Structure

The project is organized into reusable React components for better maintainability. Some of the main components include:
